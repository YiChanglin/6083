This report primarily compares three option pricing models: the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) model, the Heston model, and the Merton Jump Diffusion (MJD) model. We used Python code to predict European call and put option prices under specific parameters for all three models and analyzed their performance. The study found that both the Heston and Merton models predict higher option values near the strike price compared to the BSM model, highlighting the significance of volatility dynamics and sudden price jumps in accurate option pricing.
